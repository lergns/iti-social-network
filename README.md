Social Network App provides the functionality of creating an account in the social network of people who study front-end development and React specifically. 

You can customize your profile page as well as visit others' ones. 

The app provides cookie-based log-in/authentification. 

App's forms are handled with Redux Form library. 

App provides Unit testing of reducers (Jest) and components (React Test Renderer). 

This App was originally developed with class components and the main purpose for that was to learn how to work with them. 

Currently, the App is being migrated from classes to hooks. 

Also, Redux Form is being substituted with Formik. 

App's UI is being updated using Ant Design component kit.
